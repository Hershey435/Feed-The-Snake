# Feed The Snake
The classic mobile snake game made using the turtle module of python and basic OOPS principles.

Rules : 
1) Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
2) The more food(red dots) the snake consumes, the longer it gets.
3) For every food the snake consumes, it gains a point.
4) Game will end once the snake collides with any one of the four boundaries or collides with its own tail.
